# restaurant-billing-Project

Project Overview:
This project aims to create a simple invoice management system using C programming. The system allows users to perform various operations related to generating, displaying, and searching invoices for customers. It is designed to help businesses efficiently manage their sales transactions.

Key Features and Functionalities:

Generate Invoice: Users can create new invoices by entering the customer's name, items purchased (including their names, quantities, and prices), and the date of the transaction. The system then generates a formatted invoice with item details, subtotals, discounts, taxes (CGST and SGST), and the grand total.

Display All Invoices: The system provides an option to display all previously generated invoices. It reads invoice data from a file and presents a list of invoices with customer names, dates, and total amounts.

Search Invoice: Users can search for a specific invoice by entering the customer's name. The system retrieves and displays the invoice details if a matching invoice is found.

File Handling: The project utilizes file operations to store and retrieve invoice data. It allows users to save newly generated invoices to a file for future reference and reads existing invoices from the same file.

Menu-Driven Interface: The project features a menu-driven interface, making it user-friendly and easy to navigate. Users can select their preferred operation from the menu.

Error Handling: The system includes error handling to address issues such as file access errors or incorrect user inputs. It provides appropriate error messages to guide users.
